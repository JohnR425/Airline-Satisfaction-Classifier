A machine learning model capable of classifying whether a passenger will be satisfied with an airline or not given a variety of data such as passenger age and ticket class. I utilized Snowflake for database storage and basic preprocessing and Databricks for preprocessing on dataframes and ML model training, testing and visualization.
